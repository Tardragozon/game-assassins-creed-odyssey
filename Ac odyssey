Mainly because of the DLCs I made the version of Elamigos. Now I wanted to know where I can find the scores for this elamigos version. I wanted to continue using the version I bought, so I wanted to continue playing at elamigos. I have a maximum level and a lot of good items. Or a save file where all quests are completed except for the dlcs. or with this acsavetool how does it work so that my saves from upplay are in Elamigos. Definitely something so that I can play the dlcs on a full level and with the story completed
